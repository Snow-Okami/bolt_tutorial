## Getting Bolt

If you purchased through the Unity Asset Store, the best way to get the latest version of Bolt is by going to [http://www.boltengine.com/AssetStore.aspx](http://www.boltengine.com/AssetStore.aspx) and punching in your asset store invoice number, this lets you always access the latest version of Bolt without having to wait for the Asset Store approval process to catch up.

If you purchased Bolt through our site, you should have been supplied a download link on the return page after your purchase, if you have for some reason lost this link email [support@boltengine.com](support@boltengine.com) to receive a new one. We also send out a link for every release of Bolt to your email.
